# Job and Project Search Resources

## Introduction

I created this document primarily for individuals who, like myself, are actively seeking jobs. Being curious by nature, I aimed to create the most comprehensive list possible, and I plan to keep adding more information as I find it. 

I have aggregated data from various sources without verifying the accuracy of the data, simply collecting it from available resources, and organized it in one place for convenience. In the Jupyter notebook, I’ve included parts of the code I used for data scraping and cleaning.
